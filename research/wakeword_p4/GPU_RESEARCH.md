# Hey Nyx GPU continuation

Imported from `origin/research/macos-custom-wakeword` on 2026-11-10.
Source commit: `b59c05e0dcea3fc28b2574b1bbdf301c7a64baa6`.
Historical Mac/P4 reports remain historical evidence, not results from this host.
The unrelated `research/voice` random-array classifier only verifies GPU setup.

## Acceptance gates

- Rebuild AI-generated speech from pinned local engines; preserve complete
  voice/source partitions before augmentation and retain source WAV hashes.
- Train on RTX 4090 using actual waveform-derived 10 ms MicroFrontend features.
  Keep the previous rejected candidates as baselines, not production models.
- Select checkpoints and detection thresholds using validation only; freeze the
  final test plan before scoring the final model. Report per-engine recall,
  continuous false events/hour and wake-end-to-detection delay distributions.
- Validate actual quantized streaming inference, including reset/rearm behavior.
  Do not substitute float window classification for exported streaming results.
- Compare Hi ESP and Hey Nyx using matched phrase/acoustic conditions and the
  same negative audio at matched false-wake working points. Positive phrases
  necessarily differ. Report exposure and uncertainty for both engines.
- Require the one-sided 95% false-event/hour upper bound <= 0.5. With zero
  events this needs at least -log(0.05)/0.5 = 5.992 hours of held-out exposure;
  reused clips/augmentation are not independent original recordings.
- If WakeNet9 cannot run without its supported target, leave its comparison
  unverified and continue independent work. Board-free training is feasible;
  firmware resource/acoustic acceptance remains a separate future gate.

## First reconstruction

Install `kokoro-onnx==0.4.9 scipy soundfile pymicro-features` into Python 3.11.
Use `training/kokoro_samples.py` with the hash-checked v1.1 release assets.
The generator assigns whole English voice IDs to train/validation/test before
synthesis. Output is 16 kHz mono PCM16. These are AI-generated voices, not
recordings of independent humans. Its existing test split was used in prior
research; treat re-created scores as regression, never a fresh holdout.

`training/generate.py --device cuda` now selects NVIDIA for the pinned Piper
model. Its original Mac path remains available. Further Linux execution and
cross-device waveform checks are required before reporting Piper GPU results.
